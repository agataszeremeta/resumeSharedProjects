## Project Abstract
This research project investigates the use and assessment of low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for highway mapping applications including topographic mapping, mapping and 3D modelling of bridges, and inspection of bridges for damages, such as crack detection and mapping. Low altitude UAV remote sensing offers a better perspective and coverage over an area and provides the ability for targeted coverage at flexible visiting times.

UAV images were taken over the Markham Airport, where the runway and a taxiway were used to simulate highway environments. Various photogrammetric network configurations were tested to assess the level of obtainable accuracies. For asset mapping and inspection UAV images were captured at two highrway bridges at Oshawa and St Catharines, Ontario. 3D modelling of the Oshawa bridge has been carried out. For GNSS denied/unreliable environments Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) range multilateration was investigated for UAV localization. For concrete crack detection deep neural convolutional networks were employed.

Data collection, processing methods, result and recommendations are presented and discuss in this report.
