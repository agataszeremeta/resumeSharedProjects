# Mobile Agent Localization In Unknown Environment Using EKF SLAM

This project focuses on localizing a moving agent in and mapping an unknown environment through the use of artificial, visual landmarks. An Extended Kalman Filter in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (EKF SLAM) algorithm was applied on a dataset provided by the Autonomous Space Robotics Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS). Then, it was attempted to apply EKF SLAM on self-collected data acquired by a moving Microsoft Kinect RGB-D sensor. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain correct results for the sensor localization and environment map. Nevertheless, the procedure taken to perform EKF SLAM in the latter manner is still given, as the algorithm is expected to function given few future modifications.
