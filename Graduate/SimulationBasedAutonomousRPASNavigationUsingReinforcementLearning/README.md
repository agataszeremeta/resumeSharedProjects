# Simulation Based Autonomous RPAS Navigation Using Reinforcement Learning
A poster submitted to the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors (AOLS) 15th Annual Graduate Student Poster Session showcasing ongoing research studying the use of reinforcement learning to enable autonomous navigation of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) in aerial photogrammetry/surveying contexts.

Competing posters were assessed by members of the AOLS and were judged based on content, innovation, clarity, layout, acknowledgments, esthetics and overall presentation. The poster won 5th place ($500). The poster and its corresponding abstract are published in the Spring 2021 of the Ontario Professional Surveyor magazine.
